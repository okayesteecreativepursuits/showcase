this is the repository for my website, my digital exposition, where I showcase my creations as well as my vision, opinion, and various other things. 
it will evolve with me throughout my life, for now, I hate modern design, used to love it, but I grew out of that aesthethic, it reflects something. 

paralyzed by so much inspiration, I will keep it modern for now, which gave me even more inspiration

for now it is simply HTML, CSS and some JavaScript
